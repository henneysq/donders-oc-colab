## Exploratory Analysis of Behaviour

### Visual attention experiment

In the visual attention experiment, summarised graphically below, the behavioural results appear to be minute. However, the difficulty of the task seems appropriate as there is not a saturation in the fraction of correct responses, nor is it close to random responses (50%).

The distributions of reaction times grouped by light stimulus are nearly indistinguishable, as is the case for the fraction of correct responses. Perhaps, there is a tendency for higher correct response rate during 40 Hz LF.

For task (grating) congruence, the reaction times appear very similar. The fraction of correct responses is slightly higher for the incongruent case, though this may be driven mostly by subjecet 23 who appears to have responded randomly congruent cases.

When grouped by the visual attention side, the distributions for reaction time and correct responses are both very similiar. However, again subject 23 appears to have answered randomly only in the case of left attention. **Could the latter observation be a matter of eye dominance?**

### Working memory experiment

In the working memory experiment behavioural results presented graphically below, there are some more notable differences. Again, the difficulty of the task seems appropriate as there is not a saturation in the fraction of correct responses, and nor is it close to random responses (50%).

When grouping by light stimulus, the reaction times are very similar, but the fraction of correct responses appears to be slightly higher for the continuous light (0 Hz) condition.

The effect of the sum correctness appears to have an effect on the reaction time and the correct responses. Responses to trials with correct sums are both more rapid and more correct than when the sums are incorrect.

Arithmetic difficulty appears to have a small effect on the reaction time, in which the lower difficulty leads to faster responses. There is a big (and expected) difference in the fraction of correct responses.

## MEG Sensor Level Analysis

### Visual attention experiment

The following plots show the contrast between the static light (`con`) and visual (luminance) flicker (`strobe`) as a grand average across trials and subjects. The plots are based on the power in three bands: Narrow gamma [40;40] Hz, alpha [7; 15] Hz, and beta [13; 30] Hz.
